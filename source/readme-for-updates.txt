My advice for keeping our code repository neat is as follows:

1. Make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of ~/source by checking with "git status" or simply "git pull".
2. Make a new directory, incrementing the version counter in the solution name. (i.e "mkdir csci-4711-ess-v1"... v2... v3... etc)
3. Copy & paste lastest version you want to work off of into your new version folder, and make sure all of your changes are going there.
4. Git definitely keeps a record from all the commits, rendering this not very efficient iff you know Git fairly well. To keep things simple, lets just do it this way.
